# Water Quality Analysis at Toronto's Beaches
No LLMs were used in this analysis and project.

## Abstract
During the summer months, the Toronto beaches are frequent destinations too cool off in the hot weather. However, there is yearly issue of water contamination from bacteria such as E. coli that puts the city's residents health at risk. Using data obtained by the City of Torontos Open Data Catalogue, this paper examines the E. coli trends at the Sunnyside and Marie Curtis beaches between 2007 and 2023. Additionally, it explores the implications and causes of this health and safety issue.
